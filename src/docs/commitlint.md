# Commit Lint

[Official docs](https://commitlint.js.org/#/)

## Common conventional commit types

Used in projects that adhere to the Conventional Commits specification
Each type represents a different category or purpose of a commit. Here's an explanation of each:

### build

Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies, like package managers, build tools, or scripts.

### chore

Routine tasks, maintenance, or housekeeping. These changes don't affect the application's logic but may involve updating dependencies, configuring tools, etc.

### ci

Changes to the continuous integration (CI) configuration or scripts. This includes changes to build pipelines, CI server settings, and related configurations.

### docs

Documentation-related changes. This can include adding or updating documentation, examples, or other written content.

### feat

A new feature for the user or a significant change in existing functionality.

### fix

A bug fix, addressing a problem in the codebase.

### perf

Performance improvements or optimizations. This could involve making the code faster or more efficient.

### refactor

Code refactoring without changing external behavior. This is about restructuring code to improve its internal structure without modifying its external functionality.

### revert

Reverting a previous commit. This is used when you need to undo the changes introduced by a specific commit.

### style

Changes that do not affect the logic of the code but improve its readability or follow a specific coding style.

### test

Adding or modifying tests. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and other types of automated tests.
